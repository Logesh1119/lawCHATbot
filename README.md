# lawCHATbot
LawGPT is an Indian Penal Code (IPC) chatbot built with LangChain, FAISS, HuggingFace embeddings, Together AI, and Streamlit. It semantically searches a merged crime_dataset_india.csv, retrieves context via FAISS, and uses a Together-hosted LLM for IPC Q&amp;A, legal lookup, and conversational research support.
